    <p>
      Water, commonly known by its chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O, is composed of two hydrogen atoms
      and one oxygen atom. The subscript "2" in H<sub>2</sub>O indicates that each water molecule contains
      two hydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom. These atoms are held together by covalent bonds,
      where electrons are shared between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
