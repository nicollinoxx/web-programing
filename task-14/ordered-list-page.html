      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and prepare your baking pans by greasing
        and flouring them.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
        Add eggs, one at a time, and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with
        milk, and mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until
        a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool before
        frosting.
      </li>
