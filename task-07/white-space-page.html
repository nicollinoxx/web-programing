    <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>

    <p>
      In HTML, white space is managed using line breaks and paragraph tags. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag defines a paragraph,
      automatically adding space before and after the content.
    </p>

    <p>For example: <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code> creates a block of text with margins around it.</p>

    <p>If you want to break a line within the same paragraph without creating a new block, use the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag. For example:</p>

    <p>
      This is the first line.<br>
      This is the second line.
    </p>

    <p>This will display the two sentences on separate lines with no extra spacing between them.</p>
